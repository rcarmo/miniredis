# `miniredis`

`miniredis` is an extremely minimal server that supports a subset of the redis protocol and which I forked from [coderanger/miniredis](https://github.com/coderanger/miniredis) for experimentation.

My intent is to have a minimally working (if na√Øve) PubSub implementation in order to get to grips with the [protocol spec](http://redis.io/topics/protocol) and have a toy server for testing.
