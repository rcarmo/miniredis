    Redis-style SortedSet implementation.

    Maintains two internal data structures:

    1. A multimap from score to member
    2. A dictionary from member to score.

    The multimap is implemented using a sorted list of (score, member) pairs. The bisect operations
    used to maintain the multimap are O(log N), but insertion into and removal from a list are O(N),
    so insertion and removal O(N). It should be possible to swap in an indexable skip list to get
    the expected O(log N) behavior.
